    title: "AWS Loves Next.js",
    dateCreated: "2 months ago",
    content: `
    Today, when we develop modern web applications, we should use a suitable page rendering technique that makes sense to our application. You may use Server-Side Rendering(SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), Client-side rendering, or a mix of these techniques. br
    <br>
Next.js is a fast and reliable way to build production-ready React web applications that supports all three rendering modes mentioned above.
<br>
The best thing about Next.js is that you can use a blend of SSR, SSG or Client-side rendering in the same application as per your use case.
Because of this flexibility, the major players in the IT industry have started embracing Next.js rapidly. Therefore public cloud providers like AWS and Azure began to providing more support and love to Next.js.

    title: "Understanding Clean Architecture with Uncle Bob",
    dateCreated: "1 months ago",
    content: `
        Clean Architecture is a timeless design pattern proposed by Uncle Bob. 
        It emphasizes the separation of concerns, ensuring that the core logic 
        of your software is isolated from external systems such as the UI, databases, and frameworks. 
        This blog covers the principles of Clean Architecture, including how to achieve independent layers, 
        make the code more testable, and promote scalability. Let's dive into practical implementation techniques for building robust, maintainable applications.
